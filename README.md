A Static Analysis Guided Interactive Environment for Android.

##Setup

You'll need at least 3 components to get started:
   * Android SDK (install with Android Studio)
   * UIAutomator (Python wrapper)
   * GATOR (static analyzer for Android)

### Android SDK

### UIAutomator

### GATOR

### Other Notes
To use the WTGDumpClient to generate a WTG dot file from GATOR, place the provided `WTGDumpClient.java` file in the `gator/sootandroid/src/main/java/presto/android/gui/clients` directory and rebuild the GATOR executable with `./gator b`

The provided `validrec_sample.apk` is a small app with 3 buttons on the first page, one of which triggers a transition between the app's 2 activities. The `validrec_sample_graph.png` file is what the graph generated by GATOR from this APK should look like.
